# üí≥ Face Pay System ‚Äì Two-Step Verification

A secure and efficient **Face Recognition-based Payment System** with an integrated **PIN verification** step using a 4x4 keypad. This system verifies a customer‚Äôs identity using face recognition and authorizes payment through a secondary PIN check.

---

## üß† Overview

This project was developed as a smart payment authentication system with two levels of verification:

1. **Face Recognition** using OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library  
2. **PIN Entry** using a 4x4 keypad interface

Ideal for Raspberry Pi deployment in kiosks, secure access systems, or pay-per-use setups.

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, face_recognition, NumPy, SQLite3  
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, 4x4 Keypad
